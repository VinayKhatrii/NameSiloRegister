This script makes API calls to register a domain with NameSilo using their registerDomainDrop API endpoint.
The script reads domain names from a 'domains.txt' file, makes a call for each domain name and writes the response to an XML file.
The script then reads the XML file to retrieve the response code and prints a detailed response message based on the response code.
The API call is made with private registration enabled.

Requirements:
- A valid API key for NameSilo.
- A 'domains.txt' file containing domain names to be registered, one domain name per line.


One who is using this script have to:
--Paste the domain(s) in "domains.txt" file
The script will read domains.txt file when we run the main program named as "main.py"


Running the main program will call other python files to complete the requests and get the reponse according to the results.



---errorCalls.py

This script contains the dictionary of the error codes mentioned in namesilo's api end



---__Pycache__
This folder is automatically created when running the program..this is basically a compiled code for python program...



response.xml
This is XML file which is updates on each call...python reads this file and give results accordingly


testApi.py
This file is the backbone of the whole script.
Contains all the necessary modules and callbacks as well as methods
